```

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below: 

```{r youth-dist, echo=FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(age)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth=1)
```

```{r race-dist, echo=FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) +
  geom_bar() + coord_flip()
labs(x="Victim race")
```
